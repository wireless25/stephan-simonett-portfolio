    content: `Starting out in the late 90s with HTML and CSS I fell in love with JavaScript in the past few years with the rising of frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, which is the base for this page you are starring at, BTW. To be precise its <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>, the SSR framework of Svelte. If you havn't heared of it its worth checking out anyway. Working as a technical project manager at <a href="https://www.wearewondrous.com">WONDROUS</a> for over 5 years I was able to grow from an intern to the head of project management leading all technical realization projects as a director. In all those years frontend development was the one thing I loved the most. Learning this stuff myself and developing projects is the perfect compensation to my day job as a manager.`,
