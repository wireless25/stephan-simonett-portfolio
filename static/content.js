            desc: `A simple yet beautiful weather app realized as a PWA. The weather data is delivered by Open Weather Map, one of the bigest meteo data providers on the globe. The frontend is built with Nuxt and Vue. To save favorites and some settings of each user the application uses Cloud Firestore as database and the Firebase Authentication service for user authentiction handling.
            
            For organizing the API requests a backend service written in Node is statically hosted and distributed via a CDN, similar to AWS Lambdas, serverless functions they call them. Maybe you stubled over the term JAM Stack so far, this would be exactly that setup. TL;DR - Its the short cut for JavaScript, API, Markup, a modern approach of serving only static files for websites and applications to the client. If you are interessted I recommend you check out this post
            from XY as a starting point`,

            desc: `Meribel Ski Transfers is a small transfer business in the French Alps. It is specialized in bringing people from airports directly to the ski resorts.

            The project is based on Wordpress with a custom frontend. It is possible to book and pay directly on the website. For this, a booking backend was implemented to check availability directly and make sure there are no double or overbookings. The user can pay conveniently by credit card to book his transfer. The card is only charged after the booking is proofed by an employee.
            
            Not only the winterish and cold feeling was important but also to stick out of the crowd as there are a lot of players in the market. This was achieved with a modern look and feel as well with some animations and transitions to make the site feel fresh and living.
            
            The business is very successful thanks to online bookings. In the meantime, the company was sold and therefore the site was changed and adapted by other instances and is not in the shape as it was back when I delivered it.`,
